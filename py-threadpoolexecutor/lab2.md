## Lab Exercise 2: map() vs submit()

### Learning Objectives
- Understand when to use map() vs submit()
- Work with ordered vs unordered results
- Handle multiple tasks efficiently

### The Problem
You're processing customer orders. Some orders need to be processed differently 
based on their type. You'll implement this using both map() and submit() to 
understand when each is appropriate.

### Your Tasks
1. Implement `process_with_map()` for uniform processing
2. Implement `process_with_submit()` for different order types
3. Run both and compare the code complexity

### Questions to Think About
- When would you prefer map() over submit()?
